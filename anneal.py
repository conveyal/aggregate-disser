This module performs simulated annealing to find a state of a system that
minimizes its energy.

An example program demonstrates simulated annealing with a traveling
salesman problem to find the shortest route to visit the twenty largest
cities in the United States.

Notes:
    Matt Perry 6/24/12 
        Changed to slicing lists instead of deepcopy-ing them.
        e.g. state = prevState[:] instead of state = deepcopy(prevState)
        Huge performance enhancement (~5-10x faster)
        Should be identical behavior if the items in the state list are immutable.
        (immutable objects include integers and strings so should be safe)
"""

# How to optimize a system with simulated annealing:
# 
# 1) Define a format for describing the state of the system.
# 
# 2) Define a function to calculate the energy of a state.
# 
# 3) Define a function to make a random change to a state.
# 
# 4) Choose a maximum temperature, minimum temperature, and number of steps.
# 
# 5) Set the annealer to work with your state and functions.
# 
# 6) Study the variation in energy with temperature and duration to find a
# productive annealing schedule.
# 
# Or,
# 
# 4) Run the automatic annealer which will attempt to choose reasonable values
# for maximum and minimum temperatures and then anneal for the allotted time.
